# 🚀 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice

Welcome to my OOP practice folder! This directory contains Python scripts where I practice core object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, methods, attributes, and encapsulation.

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder helps me build a solid foundation in OOP and write reusable, modular code. It’s part of my **100-Days-of-Code** journey to become a proficient software engineer.

## 🚀 How to use

- Run each file independently to explore the class behaviors.
- Feel free to modify or extend the classes to deepen your understanding.
- Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!
